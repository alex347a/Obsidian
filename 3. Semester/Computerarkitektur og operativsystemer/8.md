### Recap

Real-time CPU scheduling and algorithm evaluation will be introduced in lecture 9 instead.

### Multithreaded programming

They need their own registers, stack and PC, because they have different operations to execute simultaneously.
### Multithreaded server

Pros:
- Responsiveness.
- Resource Sharing.
- Economy.
- Scalability.
### Concurrency v.s. Parallelism

### Two types of parallelism

Data parallelism: you distribute the data over several cores
Task parallelism: you distribute the tasks, so each core does a different operation.
### Amdahl's law

$$
\text{speedup} \leq \frac{1}{S + \frac{1-S}{N}}
$$
Cons:
