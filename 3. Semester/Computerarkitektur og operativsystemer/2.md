### Von Neumann Architecture

The von Neumann architecture is the fundamental concept of computer design based on the ability to store program instructions and the data they operate on in the same memory. This replaced earlier machines that were built for a single purpose and required manual rewiring to program. The architecture consists of three main components: the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and input/output (I/O) interfaces.

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is the heart of the computing system and contains three main parts:

1. **Control Unit (CU):** Determines the order of instruction execution, controls operand retrieval, interprets instructions, and governs information flow by issuing control signals. Each operation from a control signal is a microoperation (MO).
    
2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs all mathematical and Boolean operations.
    
3. **Registers:** Temporary storage locations for fast access to data and instructions being used. They are faster than memory because they are on the same chip as the CU. A CPU on a single chip is a microprocessor.

### Memory

The computer's memory stores program instructions and data. Two common types are:

1. **RAM (Random-Access Memory):** Stores data and general-purpose programs. It is temporary; its contents can be changed and are erased when power is off.
    
2. **ROM (Read-Only Memory):** Permanent memory used to store the initial boot-up instructions.
### Input/Output (I/O) Interfaces

I/O interfaces allow the computer's memory to receive information from input devices and send data to output devices. They also enable communication with the user and secondary storage devices like disk and tape drives.
### Buses

The components are connected by a collection of signal lines called a bus. The main buses are:

1. **Address Bus:** Identifies a memory location or an I/O device.
    
2. **Data Bus:** Bidirectional; sends data to or from a component.
    
3. **Control Bus:** Consists of signals that allow the CPU to communicate with memory and I/O devices. Each bus contains multiple wires for parallel transmission.

### Program Execution

Program execution involves the operating system controlling the three main components:

1. The program is loaded from secondary storage (like a disk) into memory via I/O interfaces.
    
2. The operating system schedules the CPU to execute the program.
    
3. The CPU fetches each instruction from memory into the Instruction Register (IR).
    
4. The instruction is decoded in the IR.
    
5. If needed, operands are fetched from memory or registers.
    
6. The instruction is executed.
    
7. Results are stored back in memory or registers.  
    This fetch-decode-execute cycle repeats for all instructions.
