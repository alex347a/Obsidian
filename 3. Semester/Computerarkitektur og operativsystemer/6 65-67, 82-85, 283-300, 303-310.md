| **Pipelining**                       | A processing technique where the execution of an instruction is divided into multiple discrete stages. Each stage is handled by dedicated hardware, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously at different stages.                                     |
| **Instruction Fetch (Stage 1)**      | The pipeline stage that retrieves the next instruction from memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Instruction Decode (Stage 2)**     | The pipeline stage that deciphers the instruction to determine its type and identify the operands it requires.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Operand Fetch (Stage 3)**          | The pipeline stage that locates and retrieves the required operands, either from registers or from memory.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Instruction Execution (Stage 4)**  | The pipeline stage that performs the actual operation of the instruction, typically by processing the operands through the CPU's data path (e.g., the ALU).                                                                                                                |
| **Write Back (Stage 5)**             | The pipeline stage that writes the result of the instruction execution back to the appropriate register.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Pipeline Stage / Unit**            | A dedicated section of hardware within the pipeline responsible for one specific phase of instruction processing.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Latency**                          | The total time required to complete a single instruction from start to finish. In an n-stage pipeline with a cycle time T, the latency is **n * T**.                                                                                                                       |
| **Processor Bandwidth (Throughput)** | The number of instructions the CPU can complete per second. It is a measure of the pipeline's processing rate.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Throughput Calculation**           | With a cycle time of T nsec, the processor can complete **1/T** billion instructions per second. This translates to **1000/T MIPS** (Millions of Instructions Per Second).                                                                                                 |
| **Prefetching**                      | An early technique to speed up execution by fetching instructions from memory in advance and storing them in a buffer (prefetch buffer) so they are ready when needed. Pipelining is a more advanced form of this concept.                                                 |
| **Prefetch Buffer**                  | A special set of registers that holds instructions fetched from memory in advance of their execution.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Trade-off**                        | Pipelining creates a trade-off: it increases **processor bandwidth (throughput)** by allowing a new instruction to complete on every clock cycle, but it does not reduce the **latency** of a single instruction (it may even increase it slightly due to stage overhead). |
| **Analogy**                          | Like an assembly line in a cake factory, where different workers (stages) perform specific tasks (placing box, adding cake, sealing, labeling) on different cakes (instructions) simultaneously.                                                                           |
