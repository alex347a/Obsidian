### Complex Fourier transform
![[Pasted image 20251002082221.png]]
On the left we have the time domain where the square wave consists of multiple sinusoidal waves. On the right the Laplace transform is in the frequency domain tries to decompose the imaginary parts. The red graphs are Fourier transform. The Laplace transform involves the red part of the equation $e^{- \sigma t}$. If you for example have a sinusoidal wave it will be decomposed and will be turned into a non-periodic function.

### Laplace transform and S domain

When passing through a Laplace transform you include $e^{-st}$, which will be converted from the time domain to the S-domain.

When $|x| < 1$ you will always converge to 0.
