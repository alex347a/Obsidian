On the left we have the time domain where the square wave consists of multiple sinusoidal waves. On the right the Laplace transform is in the frequency domain tries to decompose the imaginary parts. The red graphs are Fourier transform. The Laplace transform involves the red part of the equation $e^{- \sigma t}$. If you for example have a sinusoidal wave
