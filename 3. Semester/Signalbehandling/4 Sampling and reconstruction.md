If you look at exercise 2 for lection 3 you can see for the bandpass filter the waves are kind of oscillating or at least increasing with time, this is because when N is 5 it has to pass a bigger system and therefore the signal starts at 0 and increases with time.

### Continuous - discrete (C/D) converter
This concept is VERY IMPORTANT

### Time domain

$p(t)$ is an pulse sequence. T is the sampling period. n is the amount of samples. $*$ is not a star its just a $\cdot$ its NOT A CONVOLUTION. So you just take different points of the graph, you don't care how the graph actually looks between the dots.

If the signal is periodic it can be represented as a Fourier transform where $C_{m}$ is the Fourier coefficient. Since the pulse signal is also periodic, it can also be Fourier transformed.

Remember here $*$ is wrong, it's just $\cdot$
