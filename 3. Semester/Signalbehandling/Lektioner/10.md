If you remember from this slide:
### Approximation of logarithm

INSERT NEW SLIDE OF THIS HERE:
So you can approximate that the values are the same close to the value of $z = 1$.
### Principle

Substitute $z = e^{j \omega T}$ to understand the frequency response of the approximation on the previous slide.
