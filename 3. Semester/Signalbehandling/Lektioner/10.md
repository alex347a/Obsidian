### Approximation of logarithm

INSERT NEW SLIDE OF THIS HERE:
So you can approximate that the values are the same close to the value of $z = 1$.
### Principle

### Non-linear frequency mapping
![[Pasted image 20251113083043.png]]
Substitute $z = e^{j \omega T}$ to understand the frequency response of the approximation on the previous slide.
$\Omega$ is the frequency in s-domain analogue filter
$\omega$ is the frequency in z-domain digital filter
### Frequency warping

When mapping from the z-domain to the s-domain you have a limit, because of $f_{0} = \frac{f_{s}}{2}$ Nyquist
