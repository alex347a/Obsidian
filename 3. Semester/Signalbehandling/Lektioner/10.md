If you remember from this slide:

### Approximation of logarithm

INSERT NEW SLIDE OF THIS HERE:
So you can approximate that the values are the same close to the value of $z = 1$.
### Principle
![[Pasted image 20251113082700.png]]
### Non-linear frequency mapping
![[Pasted image 20251113083043.png]]
Substitute $z = e^{j \omega T}$ to understand the frequency response of the approximation on the previous slide.
$\Omega$ is the frequency in s-domain analogue filter
$\omega$ is the frequency in z-domain digital filter
### Frequency warping
![[Pasted image 20251113084250.png]]
When mapping from the z-domain to the s-domain you have a limit, because of $f_{0} = \frac{f_{s}}{2}$ Nyquist frequency is the whole circle in the z-domain, while in the s-domain you usually have from $- \infty$ to $\infty$ so your spectrum becomes compressed.
### Frequency prewarping
![[Pasted image 20251113084912.png]]
As you can see on the graph the digital filter is compressed compared to the prewarped analogue filter.
How do we fix this? We prewarp.
![[Pasted image 20251113085037.png]]
As you can see the relationship is not linear, it is a tangential relationship. So first you map from the digital filter to the analogue filter and then you find the transfer function
$$
s = \frac{2}{T} \left(\frac{z-1}{z+1}\right)
$$
Then you substitute the calculated $s$ from the formula above into $H(s)$ and you will then have your $H(z)$
#### Tangent relationship

#### Example (with analogue filter)
![[Pasted image 20251113085454.png]]
So when you want the analogue filter to have a cutoff frequency at $3 \space kHz$ and a stopband frequency at $6 \space kHz$, after its converted by bilinear z-transform it is warped to $2.7 \space kHz$ and $4.4 \space kHz$

#### Example (now with digital filter)
![[Pasted image 20251113090000.png]]
#### Example 
![[Pasted image 20251113090127.png]]
Here you don't use the stopband frequency directly, you just design a low pass filter and select an order that ensures the stopband frequency is satisfied.

When doing bilinear you use $c2d$ with 'tustin' which is the name of the creator of the bilinear z-transform
### Design procedure
![[Pasted image 20251113090557.png]]
### Frequency-normalized design
![[Pasted image 20251113092146.png]]
For a frequency normalized you can just make the cut-off frequency 1, which is just a prototype filter, and then later you can insert the specific frequency you want the cut-off frequency to be at. So you just substitute $s = s \cdot \omega_{a}$
