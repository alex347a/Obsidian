Analog vs. digital
Analog signal is continuos like for example $f(x) = x$
Digital signal is already discretized, so the values are already sampled, not just binary. Its a discrete time signal with quantization.

We cannot analyse analog signals, therefore we convert them to digital signals.

If your digital filter hits the natural frequency the system will be disrupted.

Unit sample sequence is an impulse, so there is a value of 1 at one moment and 0 otherwise.

$\omega_{0}$ is the sampling frequency.
