| **Retransmission**                                    | The resending of a segment for which the sender suspects loss, typically due to a timeout or duplicate ACKs.                                                                                                       |
| **Stop-and-Wait Protocol**                            | A simple RDT protocol where the sender sends one packet and then waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next.                                                                                              |
| **Pipelining**                                        | Allowing a sender to have multiple transmitted-but-unacknowledged segments in-flight. Dramatically improves sender utilization.                                                                                    |

| **Maximum Segment Size (MSS)**                        | The maximum amount of application-layer data in a TCP segment, not including the TCP/IP headers. Typically set based on the link-layer MTU.                                                                        |
| **Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)**                   | The largest link-layer frame that can be sent by a host. The MSS is derived from the MTU.                                                                                                                          |
| **Receive Window (rwnd)**                             | A TCP header field used for flow control. It tells the sender how many bytes of free space are available in the receiver's buffer.                                                                                 |

| **Flow Control**                                      | A speed-matching service that prevents the sender from overflowing the _receiver's buffer_.                                                                                                                        |
| **Congestion Control**                                | A mechanism that throttles the sender when the _network_ becomes congested, preventing router buffer overflow.                                                                                                     |
| **Three-Way Handshake**                               | The procedure used by TCP to establish a connection. Steps: 1) SYN, 2) SYN-ACK, 3) ACK.                                                                                                                            |
| **SYN Bit**                                           | A flag bit in the TCP header set to 1 in the first two segments of the three-way handshake.                                                                                                                        |

| **Round-Trip Time (RTT)**                             | The time it takes for a segment to be sent plus the time for its acknowledgment to be received.                                                                                                                    |
| **EstimatedRTT**                                      | An exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) of the RTT, used to predict future round-trip times.                                                                                                                 |

| **TimeoutInterval**                                   | The length of the timer set for a segment, calculated as `EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT`.                                                                                                                              |
| **Duplicate ACK**                                     | An ACK that re-acknowledges a segment for which the sender has already received an earlier acknowledgment. A sign of an out-of-order segment.                                                                      |
| **Fast Retransmit**                                   | A TCP mechanism where the sender retransmits a missing segment after receiving **three duplicate ACKs**, without waiting for a timeout.                                                                            |
| **Slow Start**                                        | The initial phase of TCP congestion control where `cwnd` starts at 1 MSS and increases exponentially (by 1 MSS per ACK) to quickly probe for available bandwidth.                                                  |
| **Congestion Avoidance**                              | The phase of TCP congestion control entered after `cwnd` reaches `ssthresh`. `cwnd` increases linearly (by ~1 MSS per RTT) to probe cautiously for more bandwidth.                                                 |
| **ssthresh (slow start threshold)**                   | A TCP state variable that determines the threshold between slow start and congestion avoidance. Set to `cwnd/2` on a loss event.                                                                                   |
| **Fast Recovery**                                     | A recommended part of TCP congestion control entered after fast retransmit. It allows the window to remain more open during recovery from a single lost segment.                                                   |
| **AIMD (Additive-Increase, Multiplicative-Decrease)** | The core principle of TCP congestion control: increase `cwnd` linearly (additively) when no loss occurs, and halve it (multiplicatively) on a loss event.                                                          |
| **TCP Reno**                                          | A version of TCP that includes fast recovery, making it less severe than Tahoe on triple duplicate ACK events.                                                                                                     |
| **TCP Tahoe**                                         | An early version of TCP that always sets `cwnd` to 1 MSS on any loss event (timeout or triple duplicate ACKs).                                                                                                     |
| **TCP CUBIC**                                         | A modern TCP flavor that uses a cubic function (instead of linear AIMD) during congestion avoidance to ramp up the sending rate more quickly and efficiently.                                                      |
| **ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)**            | A network-assisted congestion control mechanism where routers mark a packet's IP header to signal impending congestion, instead of dropping it. The receiver echoes this back to the sender.                       |
| **Delay-Based Congestion Control**                    | An approach (e.g., TCP Vegas, BBR) that uses increases in RTT (queuing delay) as a signal of congestion, rather than waiting for packet loss.                                                                      |
| **Fairness**                                          | The goal that K TCP connections passing through a bottleneck link of rate R should each get an average throughput of R/K.                                                                                          |
| **Head-of-Line (HOL) Blocking**                       | A problem where a lost segment in a TCP connection blocks the delivery of all subsequent segments, even if they have already been correctly received, because TCP provides in-order delivery.                      |
| **QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)**             | An application-layer protocol that runs over UDP. It provides connection-oriented, secure, and reliable data transfer with multiplexed streams to overcome TCP's HOL blocking and reduce connection setup latency. |
| **QUIC Streams**                                      | Independent, reliable data channels multiplexed over a single QUIC connection. A loss in one stream does not block data delivery in other streams.                                                                 |
| **SYN Flood Attack**                                  | A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack where an attacker sends a flood of TCP SYN segments, exhausting server resources for half-open connections.                                                                       |
| **SYN Cookies**                                       | A defense against SYN flood attacks where the server does not allocate resources until the third ACK of the handshake is received, using a cryptographic "cookie" in the initial sequence number.                  |
