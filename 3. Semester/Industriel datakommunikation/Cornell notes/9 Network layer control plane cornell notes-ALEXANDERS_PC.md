| **Per-Router Control Plane**                  | Approach where a routing algorithm runs in **each and every router**. Routers communicate with each other to compute their own forwarding tables. (Used in OSPF, BGP).                                                             |

| **NETCONF**                                   | A modern network management **protocol** that uses XML-based RPCs over a secure transport (e.g., TLS) for **configuration management**.                                                                                            |
| **YANG**                                      | A **data modeling language** used to model the configuration and operational data manipulated by NETCONF. It defines the structure and constraints of the data.                                                                    |
| **Why Different Inter/Intra-AS Protocols?**   | **1. Policy:** Inter-AS (BGP) is policy-dominated. Intra-AS (OSPF) is not.  <br>**2. Scale:** Inter-AS must scale to the entire Internet.  <br>**3. Performance:** Intra-AS can focus on performance; Inter-AS prioritizes policy. |
