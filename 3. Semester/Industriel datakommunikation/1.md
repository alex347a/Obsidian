#### Bits and bytes
Bit is a unit of information a byte is 8 bits.
on or off is 1 bits. 
4 states are 2 bits
numbers are more bits.

#### Communicating one bit
Examples are
Wire (copper):

| 0    | 1     |
| ---- | ----- |
| 0 V  | 5 V   |
| 12 V | -12 V |
Radio (air)

| AM                |
| ----------------- |
| FM                |
| frequency-hopping |
AM stands for amplitude-modulation
FM stands for frequency-modulation

Light (fiber/air)

| 0         | 1       |
| --------- | ------- |
| Color     |         |
| No light  | Light   |
| Flag down | Flag up |

#### Parallel and serial communication
Parrallel has multiple wires and serial is communcation over one wire.
Serial - one wire and you can either pull up or down to start communication. 

#### Endianness
Big Endian (Motorola)
MSB (most significant bit) first

Little Endian (Intel)
LSB (least significant bit) first
#### Information and exformation
Information is what you send and exformation is what you don't send. So exformation is how the message is to be interpreted while information is the actual message. The start bit is part of the information.

#### Protocols
Electrically: 0 - 5 V
Mathematically: 0 - 1
Logically: On - Off
Functionally, Light - No light

#### Binary and ASCII
Old ASCII used 7 bits and 1 parity bit.
