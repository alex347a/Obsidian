### Internet structure

There are more than 4 billion devices.
NAT (Network Address Translation) is used so every device using the same network use the same IP-address. 
**NAT (Network Address Translation)** is a method used by routers to translate between two different "worlds" of IP addresses:

1. **The Public Internet:** Uses a limited number of unique, public IP addresses.
2. **Your Private Network (e.g., your home Wi-Fi):** Uses a set of reusable, private IP addresses.

A NAT device (almost always your home router) acts as a **gatekeeper** or a **receptionist** for your entire private network.
