### Application architecture


### Client-Server Architecture
An always-on host called a server services requests from many clients. The server has a fixed, well-known IP address. Clients do not communicate directly with each other. Examples include the Web, FTP, Telnet, and email. To handle high demand, services often use data centers with many servers to create a powerful virtual server.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
Minimal reliance on dedicated servers. Instead, the application uses direct communication between intermittently connected hosts (peers), which are user-controlled devices. This architecture is self-scalable (each peer adds capacity by distributing resources) and cost-effective (no major server infrastructure). However, it faces challenges in security, performance, and reliability due to its decentralized nature. An example is the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol. 

### Communcating processes
Communication occurs between processes (running programs) on different end systems by exchanging messages across the network. These processes reside in the application layer.

**Client and Server Processes**  
In any communication session, one process is labeled the client and the other the server:

- The **client** is typically the process that initiates communication.
    
- The **server** is the process that waits to be contacted and responds to requests.  
    In some applications, like P2P, a process can act as both a client and a server in different sessions. For example, in file sharing, peer A downloading a file is the client for that transfer, while peer B uploading a file is the server.

### The Interface Between the Process and the Computer Network

A process communicates by sending and receiving messages through the underlying network via a software interface called a **socket**. A socket is analogous to a door: a process sends a message out through its socket, relying on the network infrastructure to deliver it to the destination process's socket.

As illustrated in Figure 2.3, a socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host. It is the **Application Programming Interface (API)** used to build network applications.

The application developer has control over:
1. The **choice of transport protocol** (e.g., TCP or UDP).
2. The ability to set a few **transport-layer parameters** (e.g., maximum buffer size, maximum segment size).

However, the developer has no control over the transport-layer side beyond these choices. Once the transport protocol is selected, the application is built using the services provided by that protocol. The operating system controls the transport-layer implementation.

### Addressing Processes (IP address and port number)
For a process on one host to send packets to a process on another host, the receiving process must be uniquely identified. This requires two pieces of information:
1. The **IP address** of the destination host.
2. A **port number** that specifies the receiving process (or socket) within that host.

An IP address is a 32-bit quantity that uniquely identifies a host on the Internet. The port number identifies the specific application process on the host, as a single host can run many network applications simultaneously. Well-known applications use standardized port numbers:
- **Web server:** port 80
- **SMTP mail server:** port 25
