### Application architecture


### Client-Server Architecture
An always-on host called a server services requests from many clients. The server has a fixed, well-known IP address. Clients do not communicate directly with each other. Examples include the Web, FTP, Telnet, and email. To handle high demand, services often use data centers with many servers to create a powerful virtual server.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
Minimal reliance on dedicated servers. Instead, the application uses direct communication between intermittently connected hosts (peers), which are user-controlled devices. This architecture is self-scalable (each peer adds capacity by distributing resources) and cost-effective (no major server infrastructure). However, it faces challenges in security, performance, and reliability due to its decentralized nature. An example is the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol. 

### 
Communication occurs between processes (running programs) on different end systems by exchanging messages across the network. These processes reside in the application layer.

**Client and Server Processes**  
In any communication session, one process is labeled the client and the other the server:

- The **client** is typically the process that initiates communication.
    
- The **server** is the process that waits to be contacted and responds to requests.  
    In some applications, like P2P, a process can act as both a client and a server in different sessions. For example, in file sharing, a peer downloading a file is the client for that transfer, while a peer uploading a file is the server.
