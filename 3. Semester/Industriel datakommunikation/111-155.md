### Application architecture


### Client-Server Architecture
An always-on host called a server services requests from many clients. The server has a fixed, well-known IP address. Clients do not communicate directly with each other. Examples include the Web, FTP, Telnet, and email. To handle high demand, services often use data centers with many servers to create a powerful virtual server.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
Minimal reliance on dedicated servers. Instead, the application uses direct communication between intermittently connected hosts (peers), which are user-controlled devices. This architecture is self-scalable (each peer adds capacity by distributing resources) and cost-effective (no major server infrastructure). However, it faces challenges in security, performance, and reliability due to its decentralized nature. An example is the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol. 

### Communcating processes
Communication occurs between processes (running programs) on different end systems by exchanging messages across the network. These processes reside in the application layer.

**Client and Server Processes**  
In any communication session, one process is labeled the client and the other the server:

- The **client** is typically the process that initiates communication.
    
- The **server** is the process that waits to be contacted and responds to requests.  
    In some applications, like P2P, a process can act as both a client and a server in different sessions. For example, in file sharing, peer A downloading a file is the client for that transfer, while peer B uploading a file is the server.

### The Interface Between the Process and the Computer Network

A process communicates by sending and receiving messages through the underlying network via a software interface called a **socket**. A socket is analogous to a door: a process sends a message out through its socket, relying on the network infrastructure to deliver it to the destination process's socket.

As illustrated in Figure 2.3, a socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host. It is the **Application Programming Interface (API)** used to build network applications.

The application developer has control over:
1. The **choice of transport protocol** (e.g., TCP or UDP).
2. The ability to set a few **transport-layer parameters** (e.g., maximum buffer size, maximum segment size).

However, the developer has no control over the transport-layer side beyond these choices. Once the transport protocol is selected, the application is built using the services provided by that protocol. The operating system controls the transport-layer implementation.

### Addressing Processes (IP address and port number)
For a process on one host to send packets to a process on another host, the receiving process must be uniquely identified. This requires two pieces of information:
1. The **IP address** of the destination host.
2. A **port number** that specifies the receiving process (or socket) within that host.

An IP address is a 32-bit quantity that uniquely identifies a host on the Internet. The port number identifies the specific application process on the host, as a single host can run many network applications simultaneously. Well-known applications use standardized port numbers:
- **Web server:** port 80
- **SMTP mail server:** port 25

### Transport Services Available to Applications
The transport-layer protocol, chosen by the application developer, is responsible for delivering messages from the sending socket to the receiving socket. The choice depends on the specific services an application requires. Transport protocols can be evaluated along four key dimensions: reliable data transfer, throughput, timing, and security.

#### Reliable Data Transfer
Networks can lose packets due to buffer overflows or corruption. For many applications (e-mail, file transfer, web documents, financial apps), data loss is devastating. A transport protocol that **guarantees** correct and complete delivery provides **reliable data transfer**. The sending process can pass data into its socket with confidence it will arrive error-free at the receiver. Applications that cannot tolerate loss require this service. Conversely, **loss-tolerant applications** (like conversational audio/video) can tolerate some data loss, which may only cause minor glitches rather than a crucial failure.

#### Throughput
Throughput is the rate at which a sending process can deliver bits to the receiving process. As network conditions change, available throughput can fluctuate. A transport protocol can potentially provide a **guaranteed throughput** service, ensuring the available throughput is always at least at a specified rate (`r` bits/sec).

- **Bandwidth-sensitive applications** require a specific throughput. For example, an Internet telephony application encoding voice at 32 kbps must have this throughput sustained. If it cannot be provided, the application must encode at a lower rate or fail.
    
- **Elastic applications** can use any available throughput, with more being better. Examples include e-mail, file transfer, and web transfers. They do not have a strict minimum requirement.

#### Timing
A transport-layer protocol can provide **timing guarantees**, such as ensuring every bit sent arrives at the receiver's socket within a specified maximum delay (e.g., 100 msec). This service is critical for **interactive real-time applications** like:
- Internet telephony
- Virtual environments
- Teleconferencing
- Multiplayer games

These applications require tight timing constraints to avoid unnatural pauses (in conversation) or lag (in games), which degrade the user experience. For non-real-time applications, lower delay is preferable but not strictly required.
#### Security

A transport protocol can provide **security services**, including:
- **Confidentiality:** Encrypting data on the sending host and decrypting it on the receiving host to prevent eavesdropping.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring data is not altered in transit.
- **End-Point Authentication:** Verifying the identity of the communicating processes.

These services protect data even if it is intercepted during transmission.

### Transport Services Provided by the Internet

The Internet offers two main transport protocols:
1. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
2. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

When developing a network application, one of the first decisions is choosing between UDP and TCP, as each provides a different set of services.
