E = edges (vertices), which is the links.

### Dijkstra's algorithm: example
![[Pasted image 20251110083550.png]]
You simply check the paths which ones have the lowest combined weight, if you can find another path that has a lower weight you update the table, if not you keep the lowest value in the table. So this algorithm checks all paths and finds the shortest path to all routers and maps them in the forwarding table.
