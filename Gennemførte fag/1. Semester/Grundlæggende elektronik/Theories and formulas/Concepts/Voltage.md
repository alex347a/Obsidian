Voltage (Potential Difference)

Voltage is the amount of [[Energy|Energy]] required to move a unit charge between two points in an [[Electric field|electric field]]. It is measured in Volts (V). Mathematically:  
$$ [V] = \frac{J}{C} $$  
where:  
- $J$ = Joules (energy)  
- $C$ = Coulombs (charge)  

One coulomb ($C$) of charge contains approximately $6.25 \cdot 10^{18}$ [[elementary charge (e) (elementarladning (e))|e (elementary charge)]]. Voltage quantifies the work done per unit charge.

Voltage in a Circuit

1. Polarity:  
   - The long line in a voltage source symbol (e.g., battery) is positive ($+$), and the short line is negative ($-$).  
   - Voltage indicates the direction of potential energy flow, from high potential (positive) to low potential (negative).

2. [[Electric field|Electric field]]:  
- When a voltage difference exists between two points, it creates an [[Electric field|electric field]], which is a force that pushes charges to move.  
- This [[Electric field|electric field]] is what drives electrons through a [[Conductors (ledere), superconductors (superledere) insulators and semiconductors (halvledere)|conductor]], creating an electric current.  
- In the case of ions transporting electrons (such as in a [[Battery|battery]]), the electric field forms as a result of the separation of charges.  
- The process continues until the [[Electric field|electric field]] becomes strong enough to oppose the chemical forces driving the charge separation, at which point equilibrium is reached, and the flow of charges stops.


Voltage Generation

In a battery, chemical reactions between the metals (electrodes) and electrolyte (acid) create an electric potential difference.  
The voltage depends on the materials used and reaches a limit when the reaction equilibrium is achieved.


[[Ohm's law]]:  
$$ U = I \cdot R $$  
where:  
- $U$ = Voltage ($V$)  
- $I$ = Current ($A$)  
- $R$ = Resistance ($\Omega$)  

Resistance ($R$) affects the rate of electron flow. A higher resistance leads to slower electron flow and a lower current for a given voltage.

[[Resistor]] are designed to limit current and create a specific voltage drop in a circuit.
