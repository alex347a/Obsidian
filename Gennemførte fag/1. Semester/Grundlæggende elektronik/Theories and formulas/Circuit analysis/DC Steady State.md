[[DC Steady State]] refers to the behaviour of a [[Capacitor]] in a direct current (DC) circuit after a long period of time. In the steady state, a fully charged [[Capacitor]] behaves like an open circuit, meaning that no current flows through it. This occurs because, once the [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]] reaches the supply [[Voltage]], the [[Capacitor]] is "full" and can no longer accept more charge.

In the steady state, the current in the circuit drops to zero, and the [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]] remains constant. The [[Capacitor]] acts as a temporary storage device for [[Energy]] but does not allow current to flow once fully charged. The time required for the [[Capacitor]] to reach this steady state is governed by the time constant ($\tau$) of the circuit, given by:

$$ \tau = R \cdot C $$

where:
- $R$ is the resistance in the circuit,
- $C$ is the capacitance.

During this time, the [[Capacitor]] gradually charges or discharges until it reaches the steady-state [[Voltage]].
