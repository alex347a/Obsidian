A [[Wheatstone Bridge]] is an electrical circuit used to precisely measure unknown resistances. It consists of four resistors arranged in a diamond-like configuration with two known resistors, one variable [[Resistor]], and one unknown [[Resistor]]. The basic concept of a [[Wheatstone Bridge]] is to balance two legs of the bridge circuit, so the [[Voltage]] between the midpoint of these legs is zero, which indicates that the bridge is in a balanced state.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Configuration**: The [[Wheatstone Bridge]] has two parallel branches with resistors. Let’s label the resistors as $R_1$ and $R_2$ in one branch, and $R_3$ (the unknown [[Resistor]]) and $R_4$ (the adjustable [[Resistor]]) in the other branch.

2. **Balancing Condition**: The bridge is said to be "balanced" when the ratio of resistances in one branch is equal to the ratio in the other:
   $$
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{R_3}{R_4}
   $$

3. **Null Measurement**: A sensitive galvanometer (current-measuring device) is connected between the two midpoints of the branches. When the bridge is balanced, there is no current flowing through the galvanometer, indicating that the [[Voltage]] difference between the midpoints is zero.

4. **Determining the Unknown Resistance**: When the bridge is balanced, you can rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown resistance $R_3$:
   $$
   R_3 = R_4 \cdot \frac{R_1}{R_2}
   $$

### Practical Applications
- **Resistance Measurement**: Wheatstone bridges are widely used in laboratories and industry to measure small resistance values with high accuracy.
- **Strain Gauges**: In strain gauge measurements, changes in resistance (due to mechanical strain) are detected using Wheatstone bridges, making it crucial in fields like structural engineering and mechanical testing.
