| **Resistor Function**         | Opposes current flow; resistance measured in ohms.                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Series Resistors              | Total resistance adds up: $$ R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots $$                                                                     |
| Parallel Resistors            | Total resistance combines as: $$ \frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots $$                                   |
| Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) | Sum of currents entering a junction equals sum leaving it.                                                                                |
| Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) | Sum of voltages in any closed loop is zero.                                                                                               |
| Voltage Division              | Voltage across a resistor in series is proportional to its resistance: $$ V_x = V_{\text{total}} \cdot \frac{R_x}{R_{\text{total}}} $$    |
| Current Division              | Current in a parallel branch is inversely proportional to its resistance: $$ I_x = I_{\text{total}} \cdot \frac{R_{\text{total}}}{R_x} $$ |
| Nodal Analysis                | Uses KCL to find unknown node voltages by setting up equations based on current entering and leaving each node.                           |
| Mesh Analysis                 | Uses KVL to solve for loop currents by setting up equations based on voltage drops around each loop.                                      |
| Thevenin’s Theorem            | Simplifies circuits by replacing complex networks with an equivalent voltage source $(V_T)$ in series with a resistance $(R_T)$.          |
| Norton’s Theorem              | Simplifies circuits by replacing complex networks with an equivalent current source $(I_N)$ in parallel with a resistance $(R_N)$.        |
| Maximum Power Transfer        | For maximum power to a load, the load resistance should equal the Thevenin resistance of the power source.                                |
| Superposition Theorem         | In circuits with multiple sources, total response is the sum of responses from each source acting alone.                                  |
| Power Dissipation             | Power in a resistor can be calculated as: $$ P = VI = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R} $$                                                            |
| Wheatstone Bridge             | A circuit configuration used to measure unknown resistances accurately.                                                                   |
