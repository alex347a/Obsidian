In summary, a [[Battery]] works by using chemical reactions to move electrons through an external circuit while ions move internally through the $electrolyte$. This creates an electric current that powers connected devices.


A [[Battery]] works by converting chemical [[Energy]] into electrical [[Energy]] through a process called electrochemical reactions. Here's how it works step by step:

1. **Basic Structure of a [[Battery]]:**
   - A [[Battery]] has two electrodes:
     - The $anode$ (negative terminal), where oxidation occurs.
     - The $cathode$ (positive terminal), where reduction occurs.
   - These electrodes are separated by an $electrolyte$, a chemical solution that allows ions to move but prevents direct [[Electron]] flow between the electrodes.

2. **Chemical Reactions:**
   - At the $anode$, a material (e.g., zinc) undergoes $oxidation$, losing electrons:
     $$ \text{Zn} \to \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^- $$
   - The electrons flow through an external circuit from the $anode$ to the $cathode$, creating an electric current.
   - At the $cathode$, a material (e.g., copper oxide) undergoes $reduction$, gaining electrons:
     $$ \text{CuO} + 2H^+ + 2e^- \to \text{Cu} + \text{H}_2\text{O} $$

3. **Role of the Electrolyte:**
   - The $electrolyte$ allows the movement of $ions$ to balance the charges created by the reactions at the electrodes.
   - For example, positively charged ions ($\text{Zn}^{2+}$) move towards the $cathode$, and negatively charged ions move towards the $anode$.

4. **[[Electric field]] and [[Voltage]]:**
   - The movement of electrons through the external circuit is driven by the [[Electric field]] created by the separation of charges in the [[Battery]].
   - The [[Voltage]] of the [[Battery]] depends on the materials used for the $anode$, $cathode$, and $electrolyte$. Different materials have different tendencies to lose or gain electrons, which determines the potential difference.

5. **[[Energy]] Conversion:**
   - The chemical [[Energy]] stored in the [[Battery]] is converted into electrical [[Energy]] as the reactions proceed. This [[Energy]] powers devices connected to the circuit.

6. **[[Battery]] Depletion:**
   - Over time, the chemical reactants are consumed, and the products build up, reducing the efficiency of the reactions.
   - When the reactants are fully depleted, or the products block further reactions, the [[Battery]] can no longer produce a [[Voltage]] and is considered "dead."
