Stores [[Energy]] in an [[Electric field]] when [[Voltage]] is applied across its plates. It is measured in Farads $[F]$ (Volts per Coulomb $\left[\frac{V}{C}\right]$) Real capacitors have losses due to parasitic effects.

A [[Capacitor]] is a two-terminal passive electronic component that stores electrical [[Energy]] in an [[Electric field]]. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. The main function of a [[Capacitor]] is to store charge and release it when needed.

When a [[Voltage]] is applied across the terminals of the capacitors, positive charge accumulates on one plate and negative charge on the other. The amount of charge stored is proportional to the [[Voltage]] across the plates, with the proportionality factor being the capacitance of the [[Capacitor]]. The capacitance is measured in farads (F), where 1 farad equals 1 coulomb of charge per volt.

Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for filtering, [[Energy]] storage, and timing applications.

## Charge stored
Charge stored in a [[Capacitor]] refers to the amount of electric charge accumulated on its plates when a [[Voltage]] is applied. The relationship between the stored charge ($Q$), the capacitance ($C$), and the applied [[Voltage]] ($V$) is given by the formula:

$$ Q = C \cdot V $$

where:
- $Q$ is the charge stored in coulombs (C),
- $C$ is the capacitance of the [[Capacitor]] in farads (F),
- $V$ is the [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]] in volts (V).

The amount of charge a [[Capacitor]] can store depends directly on its capacitance and the applied [[Voltage]]. A higher capacitance or [[Voltage]] results in a greater amount of charge stored. This charge remains stored until the [[Capacitor]] is discharged, typically through a load or other circuit components.

### Initial conditions for [[Capacitor]]
[[Voltage]] across a [[Capacitor]] just before and after a switch operation remains the same.

## [[Energy]] stored
[[Energy]] stored in a [[Capacitor]] refers to the amount of electrical [[Energy]] that is stored within the [[Electric field]] between its plates when it is charged. The [[Energy]] ($E$) stored in a [[Capacitor]] is given by the formula:

$$ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 $$

where:
- $E$ is the [[Energy]] stored in joules (J),
- $C$ is the capacitance of the [[Capacitor]] in farads (F),
- $V$ is the [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]] in volts (V).

This [[Energy]] is stored in the [[Electric field]] created by the separation of positive and negative charges on the plates. The [[Energy]] stored in a [[Capacitor]] increases with the square of the [[Voltage]] across it, meaning that doubling the [[Voltage]] will result in four times the stored [[Energy]].

## Charging behaviour
Charging behaviour of a [[Capacitor]] refers to the process by which a [[Capacitor]] accumulates charge when connected to a [[Voltage]] source. Initially, when a [[Capacitor]] is uncharged and connected to a [[Power]] supply, the current through the circuit is at its maximum, as the [[Capacitor]] starts to accumulate charge on its plates. 

Over time, as more charge accumulates, the [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]] increases, and the current decreases. The charging follows an exponential curve, and the [[Capacitor]] will eventually reach the [[Voltage]] of the source, at which point the current stops flowing, and the [[Capacitor]] is fully charged.

The time it takes for a [[Capacitor]] to charge is characterized by the time constant, denoted by $\tau$ (tau), which is the product of the resistance ($R$) in the circuit and the capacitance ($C$):

$$ \tau = R \cdot C $$

After a time equal to $\tau$, the [[Capacitor]] will have charged to approximately 63% of the total [[Voltage]]. After five time constants ($5\tau$), the [[Capacitor]] is considered fully charged, at over 99% of the source [[Voltage]].

## Function of a [[Capacitor]]
The function of a [[Capacitor]] is to store and release electrical [[Energy]] in the form of an [[Electric field]] between two conductive plates, separated by an insulating material (dielectric). Capacitors are used to smooth out [[Voltage]] fluctuations, filter signals, and store [[Energy]] in various electronic circuits.

In DC circuits, capacitors temporarily store [[Energy]] and release it when needed, while in AC circuits, they can block DC while allowing AC signals to pass through, making them useful in signal filtering applications. Capacitors can also be used in timing circuits and for [[Energy]] storage in [[Power]] systems. Their primary function is to control the flow of electrical charge and [[Voltage]], acting as an [[Energy]] buffer or filter.

## Types of capacitors
Types of capacitors refer to the various forms of capacitors, each designed for specific applications based on their construction and characteristics. Common types of capacitors include:

1. **Ceramic capacitors**: Made with a ceramic dielectric, these are widely used in general electronic circuits due to their small size and low cost.
2. **Electrolytic capacitors**: These have a high capacitance value and are typically used for [[Power]] supply filtering. They use an electrolyte as the dielectric and are polarized.
3. **Tantalum capacitors**: Similar to electrolytic capacitors but with a tantalum anode, these are more stable and reliable, commonly used in precision circuits.
4. **Film capacitors**: These use a thin plastic film as the dielectric. They are non-polarized and used in signal processing and high-frequency applications.
5. **Supercapacitors**: These have extremely high capacitance values and are used for [[Energy]] storage in applications such as [[Power]] backups and hybrid vehicles.

Each type of [[Capacitor]] is suited to different [[Voltage]], frequency, and [[Energy]] storage requirements.

## Distance and [[Electric field]]
Distance and [[Electric field]] in the context of capacitors are related to the separation between the plates of the [[Capacitor]] and the strength of the [[Electric field]] created between them. The [[Electric field]] ($E$) between the plates of a parallel plate [[Capacitor]] is given by:

$$ E = \frac{V}{d} $$

where:
- $E$ is the [[Electric field]] strength in volts per meter (V/m),
- $V$ is the [[Voltage]] across the plates in volts (V),
- $d$ is the distance between the plates in meters (m).

The strength of the [[Electric field]] between the plates is inversely proportional to the distance between them. As the distance between the plates increases, the [[Electric field]] strength decreases, which in turn reduces the capacitance. This is why the separation of plates is a crucial factor in determining a [[Capacitor]]'s ability to store charge.

The [[Electric field]] plays a key role in the [[Capacitor]]’s operation, as it is the field that stores [[Energy]] in the [[Capacitor]].

## Insulating layers (dielectric material)
Insulating layers in capacitors refer to the dielectric material placed between the two conductive plates of the [[Capacitor]]. The dielectric material serves to increase the [[Capacitor]]'s ability to store charge by reducing the [[Electric field]] strength for a given [[Voltage]]. This allows the [[Capacitor]] to store more [[Energy]].

The dielectric constant ($\kappa$), also known as the relative permittivity, is a measure of how much a dielectric material can increase the capacitance compared to a vacuum. The capacitance of a [[Capacitor]] with a dielectric material is given by:

$$ C = \kappa \cdot C_0 $$

where:
- $C$ is the capacitance with the dielectric,
- $C_0$ is the capacitance without the dielectric (in a vacuum),
- $\kappa$ is the dielectric constant of the material.

Common dielectric materials include air, ceramic, glass, plastic, and paper. The choice of dielectric material affects the [[Capacitor]]'s performance, particularly in terms of its capacitance value, [[Voltage]] rating, and temperature stability.

## Current through a [[Capacitor]]
Current through a [[Capacitor]] refers to the flow of charge as the [[Capacitor]] charges or discharges. In a simple [[RC circuit]], the current ($I$) flowing through the [[Capacitor]] is related to the rate of change of [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]] ($V$). The relationship is described by the equation:

$$ I = C \cdot \frac{dV}{dt} $$

where:
- $I$ is the current in amperes (A),
- $C$ is the capacitance in farads (F),
- $\frac{dV}{dt}$ is the rate of change of [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]] with respect to time.

In a charging [[Capacitor]], the current decreases as the [[Capacitor]] charges up, and the [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]] increases. In a discharging [[Capacitor]], the current decreases as the [[Capacitor]] releases its stored [[Energy]]. The current through a [[Capacitor]] is always related to the time rate of change of [[Voltage]], meaning that a constant [[Voltage]] does not produce current in the [[Capacitor]] once it is fully charged.

## Plate [[Capacitor]] formula
Plate [[Capacitor]] Formula refers to the equation that calculates the capacitance ($C$) of a parallel plate [[Capacitor]]. The formula is derived based on the physical properties of the [[Capacitor]], such as the area of the plates ($A$), the distance between the plates ($d$), and the permittivity of the dielectric material ($\varepsilon$). The formula for the capacitance of a parallel plate [[Capacitor]] is:

$$ C = \varepsilon \cdot \frac{A}{d} $$

where:
- $C$ is the capacitance in farads (F),
- $\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the dielectric material, which is the product of the dielectric constant ($\kappa$) and the permittivity of free space ($\varepsilon_0$),
- $A$ is the area of one of the plates in square meters (m²),
- $d$ is the distance between the plates in meters (m).

The capacitance of the parallel plate [[Capacitor]] is directly proportional to the area of the plates and inversely proportional to the distance between them. The larger the plate area, the greater the capacitance, and the closer the plates are to each other, the higher the capacitance.

## Dielectric constant ($\kappa$)
Dielectric Constant ($\kappa$) refers to a material's ability to increase the capacitance of a [[Capacitor]] compared to a vacuum. It is a dimensionless quantity that represents the relative permittivity of a material. The dielectric constant is defined as the ratio of the permittivity of a material ($\varepsilon$) to the permittivity of free space ($\varepsilon_0$):

$$ \kappa = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_0} $$

where:
- $\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the material,
- $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space ($8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m}$).

The dielectric constant indicates how much the material can reduce the [[Electric field]] inside the [[Capacitor]] and increase its capacitance. A higher dielectric constant allows the [[Capacitor]] to store more charge for the same [[Voltage]]. Common dielectric materials include air ($\kappa \approx 1$), water ($\kappa \approx 80$), and ceramics (which can have $\kappa$ values ranging from 10 to several thousand).

## Capacitors in series
Capacitors in Series refers to the arrangement where capacitors are connected end to end, with the positive terminal of one [[Capacitor]] connected to the negative terminal of the next. The total capacitance ($C_{\text{total}}$) for capacitors in series is calculated using the reciprocal formula:

$$ \frac{1}{C_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3} + \dots $$

where:
- $C_{\text{total}}$ is the total capacitance of the series combination,
- $C_1, C_2, C_3, \dots$ are the capacitances of the individual capacitors.

In a series combination, the total capacitance is always less than the smallest individual capacitance in the series. The [[Voltage]] across each [[Capacitor]] adds up to the total applied [[Voltage]], and the same charge flows through each [[Capacitor]]. This configuration is typically used when a specific total capacitance is required, but it results in a lower capacitance than the individual capacitors.

## Capacitors in parallel
Capacitors in Parallel refers to the arrangement where capacitors are connected in such a way that the positive terminals are connected together and the negative terminals are also connected together. In this arrangement, the total capacitance ($C_{\text{total}}$) is the sum of the individual capacitances:

$$ C_{\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + \dots $$

where:
- $C_{\text{total}}$ is the total capacitance of the parallel combination,
- $C_1, C_2, C_3, \dots$ are the capacitances of the individual capacitors.

In a parallel combination, the total capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitances. This increases the overall capacitance, and each [[Capacitor]] experiences the same [[Voltage]] across it. This configuration is useful when higher total capacitance is needed, and it allows the individual capacitors to share the total charge equally, with the total charge being the sum of the individual charges.

## [[transient behaviour]] ([[Capacitor]]):
**Capacitors** cause [[Voltage]] to change gradually and oppose sudden changes in [[Voltage]]. This is while  inductors cause current to change gradually and oppose sudden changes in current.

- **Capacitors** resist changes in [[Voltage]] because they store [[Energy]] in an [[Electric field]]. When the [[Voltage]] across a [[Capacitor]] is suddenly changed (such as when a switch is flipped), the [[Capacitor]] reacts by discharging or charging through a [[Resistor]] (in an [[RC circuit]]).
- In an [[RC circuit]], the [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]] changes exponentially, following the equation:
$$V_{C}(t)=V_0 e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}$$
where:

- $V_{0}$​ is the initial [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]],
- $R$ is the resistance,
- $C$ is the capacitance,
- $t$ is time.

The current through the [[Capacitor]] during the [[transient behaviour]] is given by:

$$I(t)=C\frac{dV_{C}}{dt}$$
