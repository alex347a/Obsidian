Differential amplifiers amplify the [[Voltage]] difference between two input signals while rejecting any [[Voltage]] that is common to both inputs (common-mode [[Voltage]]). Instrumentation amplifiers build on differential amplifiers, offering high precision and stability.
- **Key Features**:
    - **High Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)**: This property ensures that noise or interference present equally on both inputs is suppressed.
    - **High Input Impedance**: Prevents loading the source, maintaining signal integrity.
    - **Low Output Impedance**: Facilitates efficient signal transfer to subsequent stages.
- **Applications**:
    - **Measurement Systems**: Used in scenarios requiring precision, such as amplifying signals from sensors (e.g., strain gauges or thermocouples).
    - **Biomedical Devices**: Amplifying small bio-signals like ECG or EEG.
    - **Noise Reduction**: Rejecting interference in environments with significant electrical noise.
