## Conductor
A conductor is a material that allows the flow of electric current with minimal opposition. Copper is a good conductor because it has a low resistance, meaning it allows electricity to pass through it with minimal opposition. However, as temperature increases, the resistance of conductors also increases. This is because higher temperatures cause atoms in the conductor to vibrate more, obstructing the flow of electrons, which leads to greater resistance. 


## Insulator
An **insulator** is a material that resists the flow of electric current. It prevents or significantly reduces the movement of charge carriers (such as electrons), making it difficult for electricity to pass through.

### Key Properties of Insulators:
1. **High Resistivity**: Insulating materials have high electrical resistivity, meaning they do not conduct electricity well. This is due to the lack of free electrons or charge carriers in the material.
2. **Electron Behaviour**: In insulators, the outer electrons of atoms are tightly bound to their nuclei and cannot move freely. This is in contrast to conductors, where outer electrons are loosely bound and can move easily, allowing for electrical conductivity.
3. **Insulation in Circuits**: In electrical circuits, insulators are used to cover or encase conductors (like wires) to prevent unwanted flow of electricity to other parts of the circuit or to the surroundings. They help ensure safety by avoiding short circuits or electrical shocks.

### Common Insulating Materials:
- **Rubber**
- **Plastic**
- **Glass**
- **Wood**
- **Ceramics**

### Applications:
- **Wire Insulation**: Electrical wires are often coated with insulating materials to prevent accidental electrical contact.
- **Capacitors**: In capacitors, the dielectric material (an insulator) is placed between the plates to store electrical energy.
- **Electrical Equipment**: Insulators are used in transformers, circuit breakers, and power lines to protect components and users from electric currents.

In summary, an insulator is essential in controlling the flow of electricity and ensuring the safe operation of electrical systems by preventing unintended paths for the current to travel.

## Semiconductor
A semiconductor is a material with electrical conductivity that falls between that of a conductor (e.g., copper) and an insulator (e.g., rubber). Its conductivity can be controlled and modified, making it a crucial component in modern electronics. Unlike conductors, which become less conductive with increased temperature, semiconductors improve in conductivity as temperature rises. This is because the increased thermal [[Energy]] allows more electrons to jump from the valence band to the conduction band, making it easier for current to flow.

1. **Intrinsic Semiconductors:**  
   - Pure semiconductors, such as silicon ($Si$) or germanium ($Ge$), are called intrinsic semiconductors.  
   - At absolute zero, they act as insulators because no electrons are free to move.  
   - As temperature increases, thermal [[Energy]] excites some electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, creating free electrons and holes (positively charged spaces where electrons are absent).

2. **Doping:**  
   - The electrical properties of semiconductors are enhanced by adding impurities, a process called doping.  
   - There are two types of doped semiconductors:  
     - $n$-type: Adding donor atoms (e.g., phosphorus) increases free electrons as the majority charge carriers.  
     - $p$-type: Adding acceptor atoms (e.g., boron) creates more holes, which act as the majority charge carriers.

3. **Band Theory:**  
   - Semiconductors have a small [[Energy]] gap (bandgap) between the valence band (where electrons are bound to atoms) and the conduction band (where electrons are free to move).  
   - The bandgap is typically around $1$ eV (e.g., $1.1$ eV for silicon). This small gap allows electrons to jump to the conduction band with relatively low [[Energy]] input, such as heat or light.

4. **Conductivity Control:**  
   - Semiconductors' conductivity can be precisely controlled by:
     - Adjusting the level of doping.
     - Applying external [[Electric field|electric fields]].
     - Exposing them to light or heat.

5. **Applications of Semiconductors:**  
   - Semiconductors are used to make electronic components such as:
     - $Diodes$: Allow current to flow in one direction.  
     - $Transistors$: Act as switches or amplifiers.  
     - $\text{Solar Cells}$: Convert light into electricity.  
     - $\text{testIntegrated Circuits}$: Perform complex processing tasks.

6. **Temperature Dependence:**  
   - Unlike conductors, whose resistance increases with temperature, semiconductors become better conductors as temperature rises because more electrons gain enough [[Energy]] to move to the conduction band.
## Superconductor
A superconductor is a special type of material that, when cooled to very low temperatures (below a critical temperature), exhibits zero electrical resistance. This means that once an electric current is established in a superconducting material, it can flow indefinitely without any loss of [[Energy]], making it highly efficient for electrical applications. Superconductivity also often results in the expulsion of magnetic fields, a phenomenon known as the **Meissner effect**.
### Examples of Superconductors:

   - **Mercury Barium Calcium Copper Oxide (HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8)**: A high-temperature superconductor that can have critical temperatures over 130 K.

3. **Iron-Based Superconductors**:
   - **Iron pnictides**: A class of superconducting materials that contain iron, discovered in 2008. These can have critical temperatures up to around 55 K.

4. **Organic Superconductors**:
   - **BEDT-TTF (Bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene)**: A compound that shows superconductivity at low temperatures when doped with certain elements.
   - These materials are used in research to explore potential new forms of superconductivity.

5. **Magnesium Diboride (MgB2)**:
   - A simpler, more accessible superconductor with a critical temperature of around 39 K. It has been used in applications like MRI and particle accelerators.

### Applications of Superconductors:
- **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: Superconducting magnets provide strong, stable magnetic fields.
- **Maglev Trains**: Superconductors are used for magnetic levitation to reduce friction and allow high-speed travel.
- **Particle Accelerators**: Superconducting materials are used in the magnets of particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
- **Power Transmission**: Superconducting cables can transmit electricity without energy loss, though this technology is still in development due to cooling requirements.

### Summary:
Superconductors are revolutionizing fields such as medicine, transportation, and energy. However, many superconductors still require cooling to very low temperatures, limiting their widespread use. High-temperature superconductors offer promising solutions, but challenges remain in making them practical for everyday applications.
