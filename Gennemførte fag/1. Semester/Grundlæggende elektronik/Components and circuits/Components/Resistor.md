Resistors are electrical components designed to limit the flow of electric current in a circuit. They operate based on the principle of resistance, which opposes the motion of electrons.

1. **What is Resistance?**  
   Resistance ($R$) is a measure of how much a material opposes the flow of electric current. It is measured in ohms ($\Omega$), and the relationship between [[Voltage]] ($V$), current ($I$), and resistance is defined by [[Ohm's law]]:  
   $$ V = I \cdot R $$  
   This means that the [[Voltage]] across a [[Resistor]] is proportional to the current flowing through it.

2. **How Resistors Work:**  
   - When electrons move through a [[Resistor]], they collide with atoms in the resistive material, losing [[Energy]] in the form of heat.  
   - This restricts the flow of current and causes a [[Voltage]] drop across the [[Resistor]].

3. **Construction of Resistors:**  
   - Resistors are made from resistive materials such as carbon, metal oxide, or metal film.  
   - A common design involves depositing a thin film of resistive material on a ceramic core to provide stability and durability.  
   - Metal leads are attached at both ends to connect the [[Resistor]] to the circuit.

4. **[[Power]] Dissipation:**  
   - As current flows through the [[Resistor]], energy is dissipated as heat. The [[Power]] dissipated can be calculated using:  
     $$ P = V \cdot I = I^2 \cdot R = \frac{V^2}{R} $$  
   - Resistors are rated to handle specific [[Power]] levels (e.g., $0.25$ W, $0.5$ W) to prevent overheating and damage.

5. **Applications of Resistors:**  
   - Limiting current in circuits to protect sensitive components.  
   - ([[Voltage divider]])Dividing [[Voltage]] in a circuit using [[Resistor]] networks.  
   - Setting bias points in amplifiers and other electronic devices.  
   - Acting as pull-up or pull-down resistors in digital circuits.  

6. **Types of Resistors:**  
   - $Fixed$ resistors: Have a constant resistance value.  
   - $Variable$ resistors (potentiometers): Allow adjustment of resistance.  
   - $Special$ resistors: Include thermistors (temperature-dependent) and light-dependent resistors (LDRs).  

In summary, resistors are passive components that manage current and [[Voltage]] in electronic circuits by converting electrical [[Energy]] into heat through resistance.
