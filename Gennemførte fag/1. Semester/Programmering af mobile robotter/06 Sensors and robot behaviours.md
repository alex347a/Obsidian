**Bump Sensor**

- A simple contact sensor that detects physical collisions or contact with objects, often used in robotics for obstacle detection.

**Rotary/Shaft Encoder**

- A sensor that measures the rotation, position, or speed of a rotating shaft, providing feedback for motor control or positioning.

**Distance/Range Sensor**

- Measures the distance to an object, typically using technologies like ultrasonic, infrared, or laser, and is commonly used for object avoidance and navigation.

**Internal vs External**

- Refers to whether a component or system is inside (internal) or outside (external) the main device or system, affecting factors like accessibility and protection.

**Local vs Global**

- Local variables are limited in scope to a function or block, while global variables are accessible throughout the program, affecting memory use and debugging.

**Active vs Passive**

- Active components require an external power source to operate (e.g., LEDs), while passive components do not (e.g., resistors or capacitors).

**Binary Sensor**

- Outputs a simple on/off or true/false signal, such as a switch or a bump sensor.

**Analog Sensor**

- Produces a continuous range of values, representing a physical quantity, like temperature or light intensity.

**ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**

- Converts an analogue signal into a digital one, enabling analogue sensors to interface with digital systems.

**Digital Sensors**

- Provide data in discrete digital values, usually as binary outputs, making them easy to interface with microcontrollers.

**Robot Behaviours**

- The programmed actions or responses a robot performs based on sensor inputs, like moving, stopping, or avoiding obstacles.

**Composition, Decomposition**

- Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts (decomposition) or combining simple tasks into more complex behaviours (composition).

**Pseudocode in Robot Behaviour**

- A simplified, language-independent way of describing algorithms or behaviours, useful for planning robot actions before coding.

**Finite-State Machine**

- A model of computation that defines different states and transitions based on inputs, commonly used in robotics for managing behaviors.

**Flowcharts**

- Visual diagrams showing the sequence of steps in a process or algorithm, useful for designing and understanding program logic.

**Pseudocode**

- A high-level representation of code that outlines logic without specific syntax, making it easier to plan and communicate algorithms.

**State Machines**

- Models that define various states an entity can be in and specify transitions between these states based on events or conditions.
