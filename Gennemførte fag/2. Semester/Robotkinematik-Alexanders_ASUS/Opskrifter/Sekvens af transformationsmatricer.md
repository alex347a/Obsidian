\sideset{^{T}_{A}}{}{T} = \sideset{_{T}^{B}}{}{T^{-1}} \sideset{^{Sh} _{B}}{}{T^{-1}} \sideset{^{W}_{Sh}}{}{T^{-1}} \sideset{_{Sat}^{W}}{}{T} \sideset{^{Sat}_{A}}{}{T}

Essentially you look at the arrows, if you are going the opposite way you need the inverse, if you are following the arrow direction it is simply the transformation matrix. Also you can just use this rule:

Another example:
![[Sekvens af transformationsmatricer eksempel.png]]When its inversed the notation matches and the arrows also do, since the middle arrow is in the wrong direction.
