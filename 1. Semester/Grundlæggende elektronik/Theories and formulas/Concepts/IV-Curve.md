When you have a [[Voltage]] source and want a specific [[Voltage]] and current, since these two are interdependent according to [[Ohm's law]], the curve will have the slope of the resistance.

[[Ohm's law]] states that:

$$ V = I \cdot R $$

where:
- $V$ is the [[Voltage]] in volts (V),
- $I$ is the current in amperes (A),
- $R$ is the resistance in ohms ($\Omega$).

In this case, the relationship between [[Voltage]] and current is linear, with the resistance ($R$) determining the slope of the curve. For a given [[Voltage]] source, if you want a specific current, the resistance must be adjusted accordingly. The greater the resistance, the smaller the current for a given [[Voltage]].
