The general formula for electrical [[Power]] is given by:
$$ P = U \cdot I $$
where $P$ is the [[Power]], $U$ is the [[Voltage]] across the component, and $I$ is the current through it. This equation applies to any electrical device. The [[Power]] is simply the product of the [[Voltage]] and the current.

The equation for [[Power]] dissipated in a [[Resistor]] is based on the [[Power]] dissipated in a [[Resistor]] based on its resistance $R$ and the current $I$ passing through it.

$$P=R\cdot I^{2}$$
It is derived from [[Ohm's law]] and the formula for [[Power]] in terms of current. By substituting $U = R \cdot I$ ([[Ohm's law]]) into the standard [[Power]] formula $P = U \cdot I$, you get:
$$ P = (R \cdot I) \cdot I = R \cdot I^2 $$
This formula shows that the [[Power]] dissipation increases with the square of the current, meaning that a higher current leads to more [[Power]] being dissipated as heat in the [[Resistor]].

**[[Power]] Dissipation** refers to the conversion of electrical [[Energy]] into other forms of [[Energy]], usually heat, in a resistive element within a circuit. The [[Power]] dissipated by a [[Resistor]] is proportional to the square of the current flowing through it, the square of the [[Voltage]] across it, and its resistance. In a typical resistive circuit, power dissipation occurs when current flows through a [[Resistor]], converting electrical [[Energy]] into heat.

### [[Power]] Dissipation Formulas

[[Power]] in a [[Resistor]] can be calculated as: $$ P = VI = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R} $$
Derived from [[Ohm's law]]
### Example of [[Power]] Dissipation

Consider a circuit with a [[Resistor]] $R = 10 \, \Omega$ and a current $I = 2 \, \text{A}$ passing through it. The [[Power]] dissipated in the [[Resistor]] can be calculated as:
$$ P = I^2 R = 2^2 \cdot 10 = 4 \cdot 10 = 40 \, \text{W} $$

Alternatively, if the [[Voltage]] across the [[Resistor]] is known to be $V = 20 \, \text{V}$, the [[Power]] dissipated can also be calculated using:
$$ P = \frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{20^2}{10} = \frac{400}{10} = 40 \, \text{W} $$

### Importance of [[Power]] Dissipation

- **Heating Effects**: Excessive [[Power]] dissipation in a component can cause it to overheat, leading to potential failure or damage. This is especially important in [[Power]] electronics and circuit design.
- **Efficiency**: Power dissipation is a key factor in the efficiency of electrical devices and systems. Minimizing [[Power]] loss through resistive elements is crucial in designing energy-efficient circuits.
- **Component Ratings**: Components such as resistors, transistors, and integrated circuits are rated for maximum [[Power]] dissipation. Designers must ensure that these components operate within their rated limits to prevent overheating and failure.

### Practical Applications

- **[[Power]] Supplies**: In [[Power]] supply circuits, resistive losses contribute to [[Energy]] dissipation, which must be managed to improve efficiency.
- **Heat Management**: Power dissipation is a critical factor in the design of systems requiring heat management, such as computers, amplifiers, and [[Power]] systems.
