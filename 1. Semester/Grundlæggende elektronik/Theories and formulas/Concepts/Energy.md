[[Energy]] in electricity is measured in joules (J):
$$[J]=N\cdot m$$and is the capacity to do work using electrical [[Power]]. Electrical [[Energy]] can be calculated using the following equation:

$$ E = V \cdot I \cdot t $$

where:
- $E$ is the [[Energy]] in joules (J),
- $V$ is the [[Voltage]] in volts (V),
- $I$ is the current in amperes (A),
- $t$ is the time in seconds (s).

This formula calculates the total [[Energy]] consumed by an electrical device over a given period of time when a current $I$ flows through a circuit with a [[Voltage]] $V$.

Additionally, energy can be expressed in terms of [[Power]] ($P$) and time:

$$ E = P \cdot t $$

where:
- $P$ is the [[Power]] in watts (W), and
- $t$ is the time in seconds (s).

[[Power]] itself is the rate at which [[Energy]] is used or generated and is calculated by:

$$ P = V \cdot I $$

where:
- $P$ is the [[Power]] in watts (W),
- $V$ is the [[Voltage]] in volts (V),
- $I$ is the current in amperes (A).

In electrical systems, energy can also be stored in components such as capacitors and inductors. For example, the [[Energy]] stored in a [[Capacitor]] is given by:

$$ E_{\text{cap}} = \frac{1}{2} C \cdot V^2 $$

where:
- $C$ is the capacitance in farads (F),
- $V$ is the [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]].

Similarly, the [[Energy]] stored in an [[Inductor]] is:

$$ E_{\text{ind}} = \frac{1}{2} L \cdot I^2 $$

where:
- $L$ is the inductance in henries (H),
- $I$ is the current through the [[Inductor]].

In summary, electrical [[Energy]] is a function of [[Voltage]], current, and time, and can be used to describe the [[Energy]] consumed or stored in a circuit.
