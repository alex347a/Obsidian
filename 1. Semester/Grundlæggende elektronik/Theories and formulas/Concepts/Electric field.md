An [[Electric field]] is a region around a charged particle where other charged particles experience a force. It is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism and helps explain how electric forces are transmitted through space. The strength and direction of an [[Electric field]] are determined by the charge that creates it and the distance from that charge.

1. **[[Electric field]] Definition:**
   - The [[Electric field]] $E$ at a point in space is defined as the force $F$ per unit charge $q$ exerted on a small positive test charge placed at that point:
   $$ E = \frac{F}{q} $$  
   The units of the [[Electric field]] are volts per meter $\left(\frac{V}{m}\right)$.

2. **Direction of [[Electric field]]:**
   - The direction of the [[Electric field]] is always away from positive charges and toward negative charges. This means that the field lines point radially outward from positive charges and inward toward negative charges.

3. **[[Electric field]] of Point Charges:**
   - The [[Electric field]] created by a point charge $Q$ at a distance $r$ is given by Coulomb’s law:
   $$ E = \frac{k_e |Q|}{r^2} $$  
   where $k_e$ is Coulomb’s constant ($8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$), $Q$ is the charge creating the field, and $r$ is the distance from the charge.

4. **Superposition of Electric Fields:**
   - Electric fields obey the principle of superposition, meaning that the resultant [[Electric field]] at a point due to multiple charges is the vector sum of the electric fields created by each individual charge. Mathematically, the [[Electric field]] due to multiple charges $Q_1$, $Q_2$, ..., $Q_n$ at a point is:
   $$ \vec{E}_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{k_e Q_i}{r_i^2} \hat{r}_i $$  
   where $r_i$ is the distance from charge $Q_i$ to the point, and $\hat{r}_i$ is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the point.

5. **[[Electric field]] Lines:**
   - [[Electric field]] lines are a visual representation of electric fields. The lines indicate the direction of the [[Electric field]] at each point in space. The density of the lines indicates the strength of the [[Electric field]]: closer lines represent stronger fields.
   - The field lines never cross, as each point in space has only one direction for the [[Electric field]].

6. **Electric Potential and [[Electric field]]:**
   - The electric potential $V$ at a point is related to the [[Electric field]] $E$ by the gradient relationship:
   $$ E = -\frac{dV}{dr} $$  
   This means that the [[Electric field]] is the negative rate of change of the electric potential with respect to distance.

7. **Electric Fields in Conductors:**
   - In a [[Conductor]] in electrostatic equilibrium, the [[Electric field]] inside the [[Conductor]] is zero, and the [[Electric field]] just outside the surface of a [[Conductor]] is perpendicular to the surface. This is because free electrons inside the [[Conductor]] move in response to the [[Electric field]], effectively cancelling out the internal field.

8. **Electric Dipoles:**
   - An electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance. The [[Electric field]] of a dipole at a point in space is a combination of the fields from each of the charges, resulting in a characteristic pattern of field lines that originate from the positive charge and terminate at the negative charge.

In summary, an [[Electric field]] describes the influence that a charged particle exerts on other charges in its vicinity. Its direction and magnitude can be calculated using principles such as Coulomb’s law, and its visual representation using field lines helps illustrate the behaviour of electric forces.
