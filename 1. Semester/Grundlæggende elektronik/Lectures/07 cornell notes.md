| Noninverting  amplifiers                        | First we see that the feedback is negative, because if we assume that $v_i$ is positive then it produces a very large positive output voltage. Part of the voltage appears across $R_1$, and since $v_i=v_{in}-v_1$, the voltage $v_i$ becomes smaller as $v_o$ and $v_1$ become larger. So the circuit drives $v_i$ toward zero. Therefore it is negative feedback, because the feedback signal opposes the original input. Since it's negative feedback we can use summing-point constraint: $v_i=0$ and $i_i=0$. Applying Kirchoff's law:<br>$$v_{in}=v_1$$<br>Since $i_i$ is zero, $R_1$ is given by voltage-division principle:<br>$$v_1=\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}\cdot v_o$$<br>By substituting, the closed-loop voltage gain is:<br>$$A_v=\frac{v_o}{v_{in}}=1+\frac{R_2}{R_1}$$<br>Since $A_v$ is positive, and the gain is given by the ratio of resistors, the input impedance is theoretically infinite, since the input current $i_i$ is zero. Since the voltage gain is dependant on the resistors, then the output voltage is aswell, therefore the output impedance is zero.![[Noninverting amplifier.png]]<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

DC offsets.<br><br>Gain and bandwidth limitations:<br>an opamp without feedback resistors has an open-loop gain magnitude between $10^4$ and $10^6$. The bandwidth is limited because the gain is a function of frequency, where the magnitude becomes smaller at higher frequencies. The bandwidth is usually limited with frequency compensation, which avoids oscillation (beyond scope of book) The open-loop gain of most integrated-circuit op amps is given by: $$A_{OL}(f)=\frac{A_{0OL}}{1+j(f/f_{BOL})}$$<br>Where $A_{OL}(f)$ is the DC open-loop gain, and $f_{BOL}$ is the break frequency. In a bode plot $A_{OL}(f)$ is approximately constant until the break frequency $f_{BOL}$.<br><br>Negative feedback reduces DC gain and extends its bandwidth.<br>If we have a noninverting amplifier circuit like the one below:<br>![[Noninverting amplifier.png]]<br>The phasor output voltage $\textbf V_o$ is the open-loop gain times the phasor differential input voltage $\textbf V_{id}$:<br>$$\textbf V_o=A_{OL}(f)\cdot \textbf V_{id}$$<br>We assume the input impedance is infinite, so the input current is zero, then by using the voltage-division-principle the resistance $R_1$, which is in series with $R_2$. The voltage across $R_1$ is shown as $\beta \textbf V_o$ in which $\beta$ is the voltage division ratio of $R_1$ and $R_2$:<br>$$\beta = \frac {R_1}{R_1+R_2}$$<br>![[Kirchoffs's voltage law.png]]<br>![[Closed-loop dc.png]]<br>Therefore the closed-loop gain takes the same form as the open-loop gain. The DC open-loop gain is very large and much bigger than the closed-loop gain. The closed-loop bandwidth is much greater than the open-loop bandwidth. So, the negative feedback reduces the gain magnitude and increases bandwidth. |
