| Capacitor                   | Stores energy in an electric field when voltage is applied across its plates. It is measured in Farads $[F]$ (Volts per Coulomb $[\frac{V}{C}]$) Real capacitors have losses due to parasitic effects. |

| Charge stored               | $q=C\cdot v$                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Charging behaviour          | Capacitor charges slowly as it approaches full charge and discharges quickly initially, then slows down.                                                                                               |
| Energy stored               | $W(t)=\frac{1}{2}Cv^2(t)$ where W is energy in joules, C is capacitance, and V is voltage. (Can also be written $W=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$,)                                                                  |
| Function of a capacitor     | Acts like a reservoir for energy, delivering bursts of energy to components.                                                                                                                           |
| Types of capacitores        | Polar capacitors are not used in AC due to changing poles; non-polar capacitors are preferred.                                                                                                         |
| Distance and Electric Field | Closer capacitor plates require more energy to move charges due to a stronger electric field.                                                                                                          |
| Insulating layers           | Thin insulating layers (e.g., aluminum oxide) improve capacitance but can be removed by electrolysis.                                                                                                  |
| Current through capacitor   | $i(t)=C\frac{d}{dt}v(t)$, where C is capacitance                                                                                                                                                       |
| DC Steady State             | Capacitor behaves as an open circuit once fully charged.                                                                                                                                               |
| Plate Capacitor Formula     | $C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}$ where A is area and d is distance between plates.                                                                                                                             |
| Dielectric Constant         | For vacuum: $\epsilon=\epsilon_0=8,85\cdot 10^-12 \frac{F}{m}$ For other materials: $\epsilon=\epsilon_0  \epsilon_r$                                                                                  |
| Capacitors in series        | Total capacitance: $C{eq}=C_1+C_2+\ldots$ (adds up)                                                                                                                                                    |
| Capacitors in parallel      | $\frac{1}{C_{eq}}=\frac{1}{C_1}+\frac{1}{C_2}+\ldots$                                                                                                                                                  |
