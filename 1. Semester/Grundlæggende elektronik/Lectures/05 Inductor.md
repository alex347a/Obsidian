| Inductor                        | Stores energy in a magnetic field when current flows through it                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Inductance                      | Opposes changes in current. Voltage across an inductor is:<br><br>The unit is henries (H). Acts as a short circuit to DC current in steady state.                                                                                                                          |
| Energy stored in an inductor    | $E=\frac{1}{2}LI^2$, where E is energy in joules, L is inductance and I is current.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Inductors in series             | Total inductance: $L{eq}=L_1+L_2+\ldots$ (similar to resistors)                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Inductors in parallel           | $\frac{1}{L_{eq}}=\frac{1}{L_1}+\frac{1}{L_2}+\ldots$ (similar to resistors)                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Initial conditions for inductor | Current through an inductor just before and after a switch operation remains continuous.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Transient Behaviour             | Inductors and capacitors exhibit transient behaviour when switching states. Meaning when discharging the inductor will try to maintain its current due to the energy stored in the magnetic field. The current will decay exponentially $I(t)=I_{0} e^{- \frac {t}{\tau}}$ |
