**[[Resistors in series]]** are connected end-to-end in a single path, so the current flows through each [[Resistor]] one after the other. In a series connection, the total resistance $R_{\text{total}}$ is the sum of the individual resistances. The same current flows through all [[Resistors in series]], but the [[Voltage]] across each [[Resistor]] may differ depending on its resistance.

### Total Resistance in Series

The total resistance $R_{\text{total}}$ for [[Resistors in series]] is the sum of the individual resistances:
$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots + R_n
$$
where $R_1, R_2, R_3, \dots, R_n$ are the resistances of the individual resistors.

### [[Voltage]] Division in Series

In a series circuit, the total [[Voltage]] $V_{\text{total}}$ is divided across the resistors according to their resistances. The [[Voltage]] across each [[Resistor]] $V_i$ can be calculated using the [[Voltage]] divider rule:
$$
V_i = V_{\text{total}} \cdot \frac{R_i}{R_{\text{total}}}
$$
where $V_{\text{total}}$ is the total [[Voltage]] applied across the series combination of resistors, $R_i$ is the resistance of the individual [[Resistor]], and $R_{\text{total}}$ is the total series resistance.

### Current in Series

The same current $I$ flows through all the resistors in a series circuit. Using [[Ohm's law]], the total current is given by:
$$
I = \frac{V_{\text{total}}}{R_{\text{total}}}
$$
where $V_{\text{total}}$ is the total applied [[Voltage]] and $R_{\text{total}}$ is the total resistance.

### Example of [[Resistors in series]]

Consider a circuit with three [[Resistors in series]]:
- $R_1 = 4 \, \Omega$
- $R_2 = 6 \, \Omega$
- $R_3 = 10 \, \Omega$

The total resistance is:
$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 4 \, \Omega + 6 \, \Omega + 10 \, \Omega = 20 \, \Omega
$$

If the total [[Voltage]] applied is $V_{\text{total}} = 12 \, \text{V}$, the total current is:
$$
I = \frac{V_{\text{total}}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{12}{20} = 0.6 \, \text{A}
$$

Now, the [[Voltage]] across each [[Resistor]] can be calculated:
- [[Voltage]] across $R_1$: 
  $$ V_1 = 12 \, \text{V} \cdot \frac{4 \, \Omega}{20 \, \Omega} = 2.4 \, \text{V} $$
- [[Voltage]] across $R_2$: 
  $$ V_2 = 12 \, \text{V} \cdot \frac{6 \, \Omega}{20 \, \Omega} = 3.6 \, \text{V} $$
- [[Voltage]] across $R_3$: 
  $$ V_3 = 12 \, \text{V} \cdot \frac{10 \, \Omega}{20 \, \Omega} = 6 \, \text{V} $$

### Key Points about [[Resistors in series]]
- **Same Current**: The same current flows through each [[Resistor]].
- **Total Resistance**: The total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances.
- **[[Voltage]] Division**: The total [[Voltage]] is divided among the resistors according to their resistances.
- **Application**: Series resistors are used in applications where a specific [[Voltage]] drop across each [[Resistor]] is desired, or where it is necessary to limit current in certain parts of a circuit.
