### 10.5.3
Familiarize yourself with parametric representations of important surfaces by deriving a representation (1), by finding the parameter curves (curves $u = const$ and $v = const$) of the surface and a normal vector $N = r_{u} \times r_{v}$ of the surface. Show the details in your work. 

For reference (1) is the equation:
$z = f(x,y) \quad \text{ or } \quad g(x,y,z) = 0$.

Cone $r(u,v) = [u \cos(v), u \sin(v), cu]$
